# Basic patterns

## 1. Refactor component in `Exercise` to fit into our code style.

Narrow:
- class to arrow function
- defaulting of properties
- move propTypes


## 2. Use forwardRef and set the `displayName`.

## 3. Move Avatar to its own folder with `index.js` file.

## 4. Is there a need for `children` prop? Try to remove it.

## 5. Is prop `style` extensible? Try to fix it.
