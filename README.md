## Working with the project

### Exercises/solutions

Exercises are placed in the `exercises/*` folder.
Every exercise is its own small litle node module.
So you can install dependencies directly for the exercise.
Every exercise has its own `README.md` with the description of the assigment.


Solutions are placed in the `solutions/*` folder.
Explanation and needed theory will be explained at workshop.

## Prerequisites

- Node v10>=

I use Vim. Here is my [`vimrc`](https://github.com/tommmyy/dotfiles/tree/master/.vim).
